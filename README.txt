To run our project,

1) Open up Matlab
2) Set the search path to this folder
3) Open Lab2_AircraftEPS
   -- This is necessary because we're using the
      Simulink model to visualize everything
4) Run tests by invoking the Matlab test scripts
   -- run allfail.m // all 4 generators will crash, one after another
   -- run glfail.m  // only the left generator fails
