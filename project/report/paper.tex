  Historical data of power request on Bus 1 and Bus 2 for time 0
  to 100. Notice the spikes in power usage on Bus 2 that pulls the
  request over 100000 Watts, well over the power rating of the generators.
  Load shedding is a must during those intervals.}

  \caption{\textbf{LL-LMS Load Shedding} Notice that the 
  LL-LMS sheds much more load than the HL-LMS.}

\end{figure}

For our first experiment, we simulated the case when there are no power
generators failures in the system using the power usage profile shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:preqnofail}. Notice that Bus 1 uses more than 100000 Watts
between time 30 and 60 and again around time 90. Bus 2, on the other hand,
has a massive power usage between time 50 and 80. We wanted to see how the
HL-LMS and the LL-LMS responds to this scenario in isolation. Our results
are in Figure~\ref{fig:lshlnofail} and Figure~\ref{fig:lsllnofail}.
Comparing the results, we can see that the LL-LMS will shed a much larger
number of loads than the the HL-LMS. In particular, the LL-LMS sheds
exclusively from load 6-10 because it simply examines the priority table.
The HL-LMS; however, is much smarter. It is able to minimize the number of
loads shed by shedding loads much higher up in the priority table.

\subsection{Generator Failure}
For this experiment, we wanted to see how a combined HL-LMS and LL-LLMS
system would respond to spontaneous generator failures. To this end, we
simulated the case when generator 2 would fail at time 45. Obviously, if the HL-LMS were
to run in isolation, it would leave the system unpowered from time 45 to 50. 
Figure~\ref{fig:lsllonefail} shows what would happen if the LL-LMS were to run in 
isolation. Starting at time 45, the LL-LMS sees that generator 2 has failed and it has 
switched to using generator 1 to power both buses according to its priority table. In order
to stay under generator 1's power rating, the LL-LMS sheds a large number of loads on the 
second bus. Figure~\ref{fig:lsolonefail} shows what would happen in a combined HL-LMS
LL-LMS system. The HL-LMS produces advice to be used from time 40 to 50. Unfortunately,
there is no way for this advice to be aware of the failure at time 45. So while the advice
from time 40 to 44 is optimal and safe, the advice from 45 to 49 is unsafe. The LL-LMS is
able to see this at time 45 and kicks in, ignoring the unsafe advice from the HL-LMS. This
behavior is observed in Figure~\ref{fig:lsolonefail} where from time 45 to 49, a large
number of loads are shed. Then at time 50, the HL-LMS reoptimizes by turning on the APU.
Notice the difference in the number of loads shed onward from time 50 in 
Figure~\ref{fig:lsllonefail} and Figure~\ref{fig:lsolonefail}.

  the large amounts of load shedded in order to keep power usage below the power rating

  large number of loads dropped from time 45 to 50 before the HL-LMS can reoptimize.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Unexpected Power Spikes}
The HL-LMS performs a live optimization using historical data for load power requests from
previous flights. Due to the nature of the optimization problem, it is impossible to
program the optimization problem with live data. As a result, it is possible for the
HL-LMS to provide unsafe advice if there is a power spike. More specifically, it is possible
for the HL-LMS to generate a load shedding configuration that could have one of the power
generators driving a higher power request than its rating. We want to simulate such a
failure case and show that the LL-LMS performs the required adjustment to keep the system
in a safe state. For this experiment, we use the same historical power request as in
Figure~\ref{fig:preqnofail}. However, the actual power request for this simulation is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:preqpwrspike}. Without the LL-LMS, the HL-LMS would use the load
shedding configuration seen in Figure~\ref{fig:lshlnofail}. Notice that there is a power
spike from time 10 to 40 that the historical data does not account for and thus the HL-LMS
is unaware of. As a result, its load shedding configuration would overload the power
generator. Because we have a LL-LMS, we are able to keep the system in a safe configuration.
Figure~\ref{fig:lsolpwrspike} shows that the LL-LMS will detect that the generators would
be overloaded and thus shed some loads during this time interval.

  request and the power request expected by the historical data in 
  Figure~\ref{fig:preqnofail}. In particular, there is a large power spike from time 10
  to 40 that is not accounted for in the historical data.}
